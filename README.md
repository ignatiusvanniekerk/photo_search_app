Good day and thank you for using Pic a Place photo search app.

Pic a Place uses googgle place's for photo and location search and was written in Typescript to run in Angular 11.

To start the project you firstly need to clone the project
  **git clone git@github.com:ignatiusvanniekerk/pic-a-place.git**
once that is completed **npm install** needs to be run and to start the project up use **ng serve --open**

Hope you have fun playing with it as much as i had making it.
